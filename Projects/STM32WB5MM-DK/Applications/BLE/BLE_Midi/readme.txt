@par Application Description

This application act as a MIDI controller. The controller can send events to a MIDI over BLE Compatible device
(this application was tested with : Apple Garage Band on iOS, SynprezFM on Android). 
Note that this is a proof of concept and demonstrate a simple working implementation of MIDI over BLE but is 
not a fully MIDI Specification compliant library.

@par Hardware and Software environment

    - This application runs on STM32WB5MM Discovery Kit devices
    - This application was developped with CubeWB package v1.16.0 and CubeMX 6.8.1.
    - STM32WB5MM Discovery Kit board Set-up    
       - Connect the Board to your PC with a USB cable type A to mini-B to ST-LINK connector (USB_STLINK).

@par How to use it ? 

This application requires having the stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_full_fw.bin binary flashed on the Wireless Coprocessor.
If it is not the case, you need to use STM32CubeProgrammer to load the appropriate binary.
For the detailed procedure to change the
Wireless Coprocessor binary or see following wiki for Hardware setup:
https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Connectivity:STM32WB_BLE_Hardware_Setup
   
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and flash the board with the executable file

1. Flash the BLE wireless stack **full** on the STM32WB5MM-DK board.

2. Build the BLE_Midi project and flash the board with it.

3. Load the midi file in the external flash following this instructions :
  
    A) Copy and rename your midi file with the .bin extension. This is because Cube Programmer will filter on file extensions and wonâ€™t let you flash a .mid file

    B) Open STM32CubeProgrammer and user the external loader plugin to load your file in the external flash.

 4. **Unplug and replug your board** this is needed to apply the changes in the external flash.

 5. You can now connect with your smartphone (or another MIDI over BLE compliant reveiver) to your board and use it.
